Exploring-AG-Grids
Greetings to Exploring-AG-Grids! This project serves as a playground where we explore the Ag-Grids and its integrations with NextJs 

About
Ag-Grids is a widely used Grid library for JavaScript that provides a plethora of helpful functions and implemenation for Data handling in form of table, we are using React-Ag-Grid for our scope

How It Works
Each method we choose to decode will have its own JS file.

We'll break down the logic, step by step, and create our basic JavaScript implementation of the method. By doing this, we'll gain insights into the underlying concepts and algorithms behind these functions.

Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

To get started with Exploring-AG-Grids, simply clone the repository and explore the method files. You can run them and test them in your preferred JavaScript environment.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/decoding-lodash.git

cd exploring-ag-grids

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## [Pending] Demo - Deployment on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
